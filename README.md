# Mendeleeves Table

This is one of my first projects made in C# during my time in highschool.

Mendeleeves Table is a simple interactive periodic table application built with C#. 
It allows users to double-click on an element from the periodic table, and it will automatically open the element's Wikipedia page in your default web browser. 

## Features
- **Interactive UI**: Displays the full periodic table in a user-friendly format.
- **Double Click to Learn**: Double-clicking on any element will open its Wikipedia page.
